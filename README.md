### 3. Initial Branching

#### Team Leaders:
1. Create and switch to the 'develop' branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b develop
   ```
2. Push the develop branch to remote:
   ```
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

#### Team Members:
1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```
   git pull origin develop
   ```
2. Switch to the develop branch:
   ```
   git checkout develop
   ```

### 4. Feature Assignment

Team leaders assign features to members:
1. Home page
2. About page
3. Contact page
4. Login page
5. Sign up page

### 5. Feature Development

For each team member:
1. Create a feature branch:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/feat_[featureName]
   ```
2. Work on the assigned feature
3. Commit changes regularly:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: [featureName]"
   ```
4. Push the feature branch to remote:
   ```
   git push -u origin feature/feat_[featureName]
   ```

### 6. Pull Requests

#### Team Members:

2. Add a description of your changes
3. Assign your team leader as the reviewer

#### Team Leaders:
1. Review the pull requests
2. Provide feedback or approve changes
3. Merge approved pull requests into 'develop'

### 7. Release Process

#### Team Leaders:
1. Create release/v0.1.0 (home, login, signup pages):
   ```
   git checkout -b release/v0.1.0 develop
   # Make any necessary adjustments
   git commit -am "Prepare release v0.1.0"
   ```
2. Finish the release:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff release/v0.1.0
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Version 0.1.0"
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff release/v0.1.0
   git branch -d release/v0.1.0
   ```
